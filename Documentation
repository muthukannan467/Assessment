Data Pipeline Setup and Execution Documentation

1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:
>> Python 3.x: Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
>> Python Libraries: Install the required Python libraries using pip:
     sh
     pip install pandas requests google-cloud-storage google-cloud-bigquery mysql-connector-python psycopg2

>> Apache Airflow: Install Airflow using pip:
     sh
     pip install apache-airflow

2. Airflow Setup

>> Initialize Airflow Database
    Airflow requires a database to keep track of task and DAG state. Initialize it by running:
    sh
    airflow db init

>> Configure Email Server
    Set up email configuration in airflow.cfg for the EmailOperator to send alerts. Example configuration:
    ini
    [email]
    email_backend = airflow.utils.email.send_email_smtp
    smtp_host = smtp.example.com
    smtp_starttls = True
    smtp_ssl = False
    smtp_user = your_email@example.com
    smtp_password = your_password
    smtp_port = 587

>> Start Airflow Services
    * Start Airflow Web Server:
        sh
        airflow webserver --port 8080
  This command starts the web server on port 8080 where you can access the Airflow web interface.

>> Start Airflow Scheduler:
        sh
        airflow scheduler
  The scheduler is responsible for executing the DAGs and their tasks.

3. Deploying the Pipeline
>> DAG Files: Place the data_pipeline.py and data_pipeline_dag.py files in the Airflow DAGs directory, usually located at ~/airflow/dags.

>> Directory Structure:
    Ensure your directory structure looks like this:
      ~/airflow/
      ├── dags/
      │   ├── data_pipeline.py
      │   └── data_pipeline_dag.py

4. Running the Pipeline

>> Access Airflow Web Interface: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080.
>> Trigger DAG: In the Airflow web interface, find the DAG named data_pipeline_dag and trigger it manually or set it to run on a schedule.

5. Data Quality Metrics
  
  To monitor the quality of your data, query the data_quality_metrics table for recent metrics. Use the following SQL query:
      SELECT * FROM data_quality_metrics ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;

  This query retrieves the most recent 10 records from the data_quality_metrics table.  

6. Alerting
  
    Make sure email configuration is correctly set up to receive notifications. 
    Alerts will help us stay informed about any issues or failures in the pipeline.


Bonus: Performance Optimization
Enhance the performance and efficiency of data pipeline with the following strategies:

Parallel Processing: 
    Consider using distributed data processing frameworks like Apache Spark or Dask to handle large-scale data processing tasks more efficiently.

Efficient Data Storage: 
    Opt for columnar storage formats such as Parquet or ORC, which are optimized for querying and can improve performance compared to row-based formats.

Caching: 
    Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to reduce retrieval times and lower the load on your data sources.

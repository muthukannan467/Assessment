Schema for Data Quality Metrics:

```sql
CREATE TABLE data_quality_metrics (
    metric_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    pipeline_stage VARCHAR(50),
    metric_name VARCHAR(100),
    metric_value FLOAT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
```

Sample Data:

```sql
INSERT INTO data_quality_metrics (pipeline_stage, metric_name, metric_value)
VALUES
    ('Data Collection', 'Record Count', 5000),
    ('Data Processing', 'Null Values', 10),
    ('Data Storage', 'Storage Size (MB)', 200);
```

Schema for Data Quality Metrics:
The schema for the data_quality_metrics table is designed to capture various metrics related to the quality of data at different stages of the data pipeline. 
Here’s a detailed explanation of each field in the schema:

CREATE TABLE data_quality_metrics (
    metric_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,            -- Unique identifier for each metric entry
    pipeline_stage VARCHAR(50),              -- Stage in the data pipeline where the metric was collected
    metric_name VARCHAR(100),                -- Name of the metric being recorded
    metric_value FLOAT,                      -- Value of the metric
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- Timestamp when the metric was recorded
);

metric_id: A unique identifier for each record in the table, automatically incremented with each new entry.
pipeline_stage: The specific stage in the data pipeline where the metric is measured (e.g., data collection, processing, storage).
metric_name: The name of the metric (e.g., "Record Count", "Null Values").
metric_value: The value of the metric, stored as a float to accommodate different types of measurements.
timestamp: The time at which the metric was recorded, with a default value of the current timestamp.

Sample Data:
Here’s how you might insert sample data into the data_quality_metrics table:

INSERT INTO data_quality_metrics (pipeline_stage, metric_name, metric_value)
VALUES
    ('Data Collection', 'Record Count', 5000),
    ('Data Processing', 'Null Values', 10),
    ('Data Storage', 'Storage Size (MB)', 200);

Record Count: Indicates the number of records collected during the data collection stage. In this example, 5000 records were collected.
Null Values: Shows the number of null values found in the data during the processing stage. Here, there were 10 null values.
Storage Size (MB): Represents the size of the data stored in megabytes during the storage stage. The example shows a storage size of 200 MB.
